;;; This is the master value for LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION. It's
;;; separated into its own file here so that it's easy for
;;; text-munging make-ish or cvs-ish scripts to find and tweak it. For
;;; the convenience of such scripts, only a simple subset of Lisp
;;; reader syntax should be used here: semicolon-delimited comments,
;;; possible blank lines or other whitespace, and a single
;;; double-quoted string value alone on its own line.
;;;
;;; Local additions to the version number can be effected via
;;; branch-version.lisp-expr, which is not stored in the CVS.
;;;
;;; ANSI says LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION can be NIL "if no
;;; appropriate and relevant result can be produced", but as long as
;;; we control the build, we can always assign an appropriate and
;;; relevant result, so this must be a string, not NIL.
;;;
;;; Conventionally a string like "0.6.6", with three numeric fields,
;;; is used for released versions, and a string like "0.6.5.xyzzy",
;;; with something arbitrary in the fourth field, is used for CVS
;;; checkins which aren't released. (And occasionally for internal
;;; versions, especially for internal versions off the main CVS
;;; branch, it gets hairier, e.g. "0.pre7.14.flaky4.13".)
"1.0.46.30"
